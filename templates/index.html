    <p>This is the live demo of Webimage, the Website preview generation tool.
        The website will be rendered using Webkit on a headless Linux server. The tool was written in C++ and is <a href="http://github.com/raphaelcruzeiro/webimage">open source code</a>.
    If you want to know some technical details of the tool <a href="http://raphaelcruzeiro.com/blog/2012/05/28/an-improved-website-preview-generation-tool-using-webkit/">you can check this post on my blog.</a></p>
